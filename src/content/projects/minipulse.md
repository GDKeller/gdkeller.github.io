Wrote C++ on a single ESP32 SoC to fetch XML data from NASA's Deep Space Network API, providing information on real time data transmission with active spacecraft. Parsed spacecraft names and transmission rates, which was then visualized on the LEDs via hand-crafted character maps and 5 different animation patterns with 6 levels of intensity based on transmission rate.

Engineered a custom WiFi portal to allow configuration and updating of the device from a phone or other device via ESP32 onboard WiFi. Delivered production-ready software package for a limited hardware run of units.
