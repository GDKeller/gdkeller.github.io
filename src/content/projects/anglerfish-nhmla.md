Designed, built and installed an Arduino-driven light sensor system for the display of a rare Pacific anglerfish specimen. The fish's tissue is highly sensitive to light, so the ichthyology collection staff needed a way to limit and track light exposure. We wired a motion sensor to the cabinet lights, so they only turned on when a visitor approached the display. A light sensor then continuously measured the amount of light striking the specimen and uploaded it to an online spreadsheet for later analysis. Additionally, we took a LiDAR scan of the specimen and 3d printed a full-scale model which was embedded into the signage to provide tactile interaction.
