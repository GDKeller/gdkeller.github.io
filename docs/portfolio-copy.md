## Key Copy Principles Used

**Language Choices:**
- "Translate" (reinforces business-tech bridge)
- "Elegant solutions" (shows design thinking)
- Specific impact metrics (business-focused)
- Technical terms balanced with outcomes

**Structure Decisions:**
- Each project shows business problem → technical solution → measurable impact
- Skills organized by application, not just technology lists
- Progressive disclosure (hero → differentiator → proof → capabilities)

**Tone:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Business-aware without being buzzword-heavy
- Technical credibility without overwhelming

This structure works for WordPress agencies (emphasizes client work), AI startups (shows AI experience), and general frontend roles (demonstrates range). The business translation theme runs through every section.
