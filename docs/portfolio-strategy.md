# Portfolio Strategy & Structure

**STATUS: DRAFT IDEAS - NOT YET APPROVED**
*These are brainstorming concepts that need review and approval before implementation*

---

## Core Strategic Framework

**Lead with Frontend, Layer in Specializations**
Your frontend experience is your strongest foundation and most employable skill. Use it as the primary narrative thread, then weave in AI and embedded work as differentiators rather than competing focuses.

## Key Positioning Strategy

**Primary Differentiator**: Business-to-technical translation ability
- This is senior IC/tech lead territory 
- Applies across all domains (WordPress agencies, AI startups, general frontend)
- Most developers struggle with stakeholder communication - you don't

## Organizational Approaches

### Single-Page Focus
Keep it simple with one comprehensive page that tells your complete story without requiring navigation or complex user paths.

### Content Strategy for Each Audience

**For WordPress/Agency Roles:**
- Emphasize component thinking, maintainable code
- Show understanding of client needs, project constraints
- Position AI knowledge as "future-proofing" ability

**For AI Startup Roles:**
- Lead with AI company experience
- Show frontend skills in context of ML products
- Embedded background shows technical depth

**Universal Differentiators:**
- "Frontend developer who understands the full stack"
- "Can bridge technical complexity with user experience"
- "Builds interfaces for both humans and systems"

## Content Principles

- **Every sentence** should reinforce the business-tech translation theme
- **Concrete examples** over abstract skills lists  
- **Business impact** mentioned in every project
- **Technical depth** shown through project complexity, not buzzword lists

## Visual Hierarchy Guidelines

- **Scannable**: Clear sections, bullet points, white space
- **Mobile-first**: Works on phone (recruiters check on mobile)
- **Fast-loading**: No fancy animations or heavy assets
- **Professional**: Clean typography, consistent spacing

## Universal Value Proposition

"Senior Frontend Developer who bridges business & technology"

This works for agencies, startups, and everything in between. Sometimes the best differentiation is just being really clear about your value rather than getting fancy with the presentation.
